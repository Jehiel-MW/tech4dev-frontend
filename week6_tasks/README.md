# ASSIGNMENT 2

# A student who just got admission into University is about to relocate to where his school is located and he doesn't know how far the place is from his current location, so we are assuming this to be n

# He is considering using any of these three platforms to get there, by taxi, by bus or by train...

# He decided to make some enquiry regarding His travelling and she gathered some information that is below...

# To travel by taxi, he must first pay a starting fee of 0.70 nairas this is like a show of interest fee that is not refundable, we can also call this fee a commitment fee. Then, if he is to travel by day, that is during the daytime, he will be charged a service fee of 0.79 nairas for each kilometre but if he enjoys night adventure he will be charged 0.90 nairas per kilometre.

# For the bus, no commitment fee is attached and the rate for both day and night travelling is the same which is 0.09 but the only constraint here is that the distance should not be less than 20km...

# For travelling by train also, no commitment fee and the rate for night and day is 0.06 naira and the constraint is that he won't be going less than 100km...

# We need to solve this using a Javascript function that takes input from an HTML file

# The second thing is that the maximum number of kilometres that can be travelled is 5000 and the minimum is 1

# Our HTML input must have both distance to be travelled which is in kilometres and the time of travel which can be either day or night...

# With the constraint for both bus and train, we must compute a result that must consist of constraints

# Remember to no forget that the taxi has a starting fee

# Lastly, our program should be able to help other future student to determine the price of covering every kilometer above 1km not exceed 5000km for either daytime or night time...
